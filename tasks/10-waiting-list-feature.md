# Feature Plan: Waiting List Display During Draft

## Description
Display a live, accessible list of all participants who are still waiting to be assigned to a team during the draft phase. The list should update after each pick and be clearly visible to the user.

## Subtasks
- Design the UI for the waiting list (e.g., sidebar, panel, or section in the draft phase)
- Update the waiting list after each draft pick
- Ensure the list is accessible (screen reader friendly, keyboard navigable)
- Style the list to match the current theme
- Test with various numbers of participants

## Acceptance Criteria
- The waiting list is visible during the draft phase
- The list updates immediately after each pick
- The list is accessible and easy to read
- No assigned participant remains in the waiting list

## Rationale
A live waiting list improves transparency and user engagement, letting users see who is still "in the hat" and increasing excitement during the draft process.

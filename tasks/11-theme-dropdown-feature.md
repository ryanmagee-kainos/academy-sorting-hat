# Feature Plan: Theme and Color Scheme Dropdown

## Description
Add a dropdown menu to the app that allows users to select from multiple themes and color schemes. The app's appearance should update in real time based on the selected theme, and the feature should be accessible and easy to use.

## Subtasks
- Design the dropdown UI (placement, accessibility, and style)
- Define a set of themes (e.g., light, dark, high-contrast, custom color palettes)
- Implement state management for the selected theme
- Update Tailwind or CSS classes dynamically based on the theme
- Ensure all UI elements respond to theme changes
- Store the selected theme in memory (optional: persist in localStorage)
- Test for accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can select a theme from a dropdown menu
- The app's colors and appearance update immediately
- The dropdown is accessible and easy to use
- All UI elements reflect the selected theme

## Rationale
A theme dropdown improves accessibility and user comfort, allowing users to choose the look and feel that best suits their needs and environment.

# Feature Plan: Team Participant Counter Display

## Description
Display a live counter next to each team during the draft and results phases, showing how many participants have been assigned to that team. The counter should update after each pick and be clearly visible and accessible.

## Subtasks
- Design the UI for the team counter (placement, style, accessibility)
- Update the counter after each draft pick and in the results phase
- Ensure the counter is accessible (screen reader friendly, clear contrast)
- Test with various numbers of teams and participants

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each team displays a live counter of assigned participants during draft and results
- The counter updates immediately after each pick
- The counter is accessible and easy to read
- The counter is visually distinct from other team info

## Rationale
A live counter provides instant feedback on team sizes, helps users track progress, and ensures transparency and fairness during the draft process.

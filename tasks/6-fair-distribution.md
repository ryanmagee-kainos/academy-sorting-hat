# Task: Fair Distribution

## Description
Ensure the draft algorithm distributes participants as evenly as possible across all teams, handling remainders appropriately (e.g., 23 people, 5 teams = 5,5,5,4,4). External JS frameworks may be used for distribution logic and UI.

## Subtasks
- Implement even distribution logic
- Handle remainder participants fairly
- Test with various team/participant counts

## Acceptance Criteria
- Teams have as close to equal numbers as possible
- Remainders are distributed fairly
- Algorithm works for all valid input sizes
